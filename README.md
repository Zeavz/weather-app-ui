# Welcome to my Weather App :)

My first React project! 🙏

The UI is deployed here: https://reverent-kepler-dc499d.netlify.app/

Built using React on the front end with NestJs on the back 💻
This is a PWA app, can view it in browser or even try downloading it to your phone!

You can follow the generic react instructions I kept below to run the app locally, or if you'd like feel free to make changes and push into the `develop` branch it will auto deploy to the Netlify server.

you can also find the api service here: https://github.com/Zeavz/weather-app-api, same running steps apply, feel free to make changes and deploy to `develop`. The api deploys to a `heroku` server instead: https://jenis-weather-api.herokuapp.com/


## backlog/learnings:
- Adding input validators on the google search bar
- Leveraging device location to do weather searches
- Ideally should minify the app and maybe try to hide the google api key better if this was a real prod app
- Refactoring and adding tests for the react code... was an interesting challenge but realized how much I need to learn in react
- The downstream api only accepts queries in the format of `city, state, country` and it seems there are some cases where a google search will only have `x,y` which will return a 400 error... investigation required to see if that should or shouldn't be allowed 🤔


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
